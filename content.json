[{"title":"Usage of \"express.static\" in Framework Express","date":"2018-02-09T04:01:49.000Z","path":"2018/usage-express-static/","text":"Express framework is the first choice for most People using nodejs as server. In Express, everyone will use the method:1app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public')); This code makes root directory + /public as static files directory, also we can write it as:1app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public'))); But why could this code snippet help us set the static files directory? what did it do? So let’s start with the static files. Static FilesWe can understand static files as files whose content won’t change for different users. No matter who visit a website, the images, the css style or the frontend javascript in it are the same, we call these files as “static files”. Then, those files responsive to different users with different actions are dynamic files, those could be .jsp files, php files or js files on nodejs server. app.use() And what did app.use() do? Let’s check what the official api says:A route will match any path that follows its path immediately with a “/”. For example: app.use(‘/apple’, …) will match “/apple”, “/apple/images”, “/apple/images/news”, and so on. Since path defaults to “/”, middleware mounted without a path will be executed for every request to the app.For example, this middleware function will be executed for every request to the app: 1234app.use(function (req, res, next) &#123; console.log(‘Time: %d’, Date.now()); next();&#125;); Clearly, it will handle the request from path ‘/‘ as well as paths under it. For example, if we set the path as ‘/apple’, when the requesting paths are ‘/apple’, ‘/apple/images’, ‘/apple/images/news’, all of them will be handled by middleware.More info: Expressjs express.static","categories":[{"name":"WebDev","slug":"WebDev","permalink":"http://wilzxl.github.io/categories/WebDev/"}],"tags":[{"name":"MEANstack","slug":"MEANstack","permalink":"http://wilzxl.github.io/tags/MEANstack/"},{"name":"Framework","slug":"Framework","permalink":"http://wilzxl.github.io/tags/Framework/"}]},{"title":"Test for Markdown Grammer","date":"2018-02-03T05:20:05.000Z","path":"2018/test/","text":"Another way to show images but can’t adjust size Just a test!Table：XMLHttpRequest.readyState constant value mean UNSENT 0 Client has been created. open() not called yet OPENED 1 open() has been called HEADERS_RECEIVED 2 send() has been called, and headers and status are available LOADING 3 Downloading; responseText holds partial data DONE 4 The operation is complete Head 1Head 21$ hexo new \"My New Post\" Link More info: Server citation [quote with author &amp; book]Do not just seek happiness for yourself.
